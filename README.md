# Sentimental-Analysis-on-Text-Translation
This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of translated text to identify emotions such as positive, negative, or neutral. Text data is collected in multiple languages, preprocessed (tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming), and then translated into a common language (English) for consistency.
